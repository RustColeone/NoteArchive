# Note Archives
This used to be GeneralHomeworkTackler where I: attemp to tackle every homework assignment only with the language that is currently learning.

Now: Archive with all my works that I am done with or no longer need to work on, contains notes written in LaTeX, and my codes which made my life easier.
## Getting Started
If you want to compile the Tex code yourself, you might want to install LaTeX package, setup and environment so you can compile them; or you can simply use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)

If you want to use the python functions, you might need to install the dependencies, which can be done by:
```
python -m pip install -r PythonRequirements.txt
```
